Research Proposal
-----------------

The goal of the research proposal is to give you a "jump start" on working on a topic that you could (ideally) present in an upcoming labor lunch, and develop into a research paper. The proposal should be at least 10 pages double-spaced, and should cover the following:

1.  a clear statement of your research question;
2.  brief motivation for your research question: Why is this question important? What is the policy relevance?;
3.  review of the relevant theoretical and / or empirical literature;
4.  description of your proposed empirical strategy and proposed data sources;
5.  clear discussion of your potential contribution to the prior literature;
6.  clear discussion of what challenges you expect to encounter.

Think of this document as the shell of a research paper that contains everything but your findings: You will motivate the question; place it in the literature; lay out your data sources and empirical strategy; and explain how you would interpret different sets of possible findings.
