Participation in 14.999
-----------------------

The class 14.999 _Topics in Inequality_ taught by Daren Acemoglu, David Autor, and Ivan Werning, was offered for the first time in Spring 2015, meeting 1 session / week for 1.5 hours / session. There will be _limited_ overlap between 14.662 and 14.999. _Please plan to attend (at least) the first three lectures of 14.999 which will be taught by Autor_. These three lectures will dovetail with 14.662 and should be considered part of the 14.662 sequence.
